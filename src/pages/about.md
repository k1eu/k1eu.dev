## 🐺 Introduction

Hello! My name is Tomasz Kielar, but everybody calls me k1eu(q). I’ve been on this world since the very round year of 2000. 📅

## 💼 Work

I’m currently a Web & Mobile developer at Selleo where I focus on delivering high-quality code (mostly in Typescript 🖤), as well as architecting performant and scalable apps. I'm deeply invested in knowledge sharing within the company community 🚀

## 👨🏽‍💻 Community

You can also find me on IT conferences. I have taken part in the biggest React Native 📱 conferences such as AppJS conf, React Native EU, as well as smaller ones like BBdays4.IT or MeetJS. As a React Specialist I enjoy sharing my knowledge by speaking at mentioned conferences or take active part in discussion panels. ⚛️

## 🏎️ Hobbies

In my free time, I really enjoy coding my own ideas, but life is not all about computers! 🤓 Outside of IT I’m an enthusiast of fast cars - currently owning old school Audi TT (2000). What's more I'm a gym lover and I like to play on an electric guitar from time to time. 🎸
