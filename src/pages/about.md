## 🐺 Introduction

Hello! My name is Tomasz Kielar, but everybody calls me k1eu(q). I’m a Web & Mobile developer mostly into Typescript ecosystem.

Putting work aside I love driving cars next to a beautiful view, especially in my BMW Series 3. Except that pretty basic guy - hitting gym, playing games & guitar.

## 👨🏽‍💻 Community

You can also find me on IT conferences. I have taken part in the conferences such as AppJS conf, React Native EU, Wroclove.rb as well as smaller ones like BBdays4.IT or MeetJS. As a experienced React developer I enjoy sharing my knowledge by speaking at mentioned conferences or take active part in discussion panels. ⚛️
