        Hi, I'm <b>Tomasz Kielar</b>. Mostly known as <b>k1eu</b>(q). <br /> I'm <Age /> years old and I'm situated
        in Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

      <p class="mt-4">
        You already know the dev stuff about me since it's on the main page. Outside of that I've been a passionate
        gamer since I was a kid. I used to play a lot of Mario with my mom when I was probably like 3 or 4 yrs old. We
        also played a lot of other games together like Harry Potter or Need for Speed Underground 2.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The latter also sparked my interest in cars and I've been a car enthusiast since then. I love to drive and
        currently I own a 2018 BMW 330e. Previously I owned a 2000 Audi TT.
      </p>

        I also love everything tech-related and take pictures with my Fujifilm X-S20. My fav optics are Fujinon 33mm 1.4.
        You can find the pictures on my instagram or portfolio.
