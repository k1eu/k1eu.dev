# k1eu.dev blog

This is a blog that can be visited [here](https://k1eu.dev). It's built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Goals I wanted to achieve:

- ðŸ““ Minimal, rough, old-school styling
- ðŸŒ™ With a touch of modernity (dark-mode)
- ðŸ“± Mobile friendly
- ðŸ’» As close to web standards as possible

## How to run

Get required NodeJS version from `.tool-versions` and `pnpm`

- git clone it
- run `pnpm install` inside


Now you can use `pnpm dev` to start developing on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                           |

| `pnpm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `pnpm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
